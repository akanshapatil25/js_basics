Document Object Model (DOM) is a programming interface for HTML and XML documents.
It represents the structure of a web page as a tree of objects that can be modified using JavaScript.

on top of the heirarchy we have window -> document -> is split 2 ways head and body

and head and body are split into various divs or paragraphs(which are porvided with names) basically attributes

                                            
document.getElementById()
takes one element by its id and eturns the first element with the matching id

document.getElementsByClassName
takes multiple elements by class name and returns an HTMLCollection (it is like array but not the same)


getAttribute(attributeName)
gets the value of the specified attribute from an HTML element.

we can also set attribute in this way

we also have a way of accesing style
document.style 
document.title.style.color = "blue";

helps us in modifying the style of a text or paragraph


event listner
a function awaiting for a certain action to occur so that the fucntion code can be executed

element.addEventListener('eventType', functionToRun);
element is basically the html element that will get effected by an event that occurs like click,mousover etc.
